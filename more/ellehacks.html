            <h3>BRIEF</h3>
            <p>
                Keywords were fun, inviting, and modern. <br>
                I was asked to give a fresh, new look to the brand, while still keeping the page familiar to previous
                visitors.
            </p>

            <div class="divider"></div>

            <h3>PROCESS</h3>
            <p>
                The first thing I did was gather some basic and important information:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>how many pages or sections were required,</li>
                <li>what the heirarchy of information was, i.e. the importance of certain sections, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Once that was settled, we decided on a colour palette and decided that the colour of the year was
                yellow.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I played around with abstract shapes and the colour of the year (yellow). This was a one page site which
                meant I had to include everything on this page without overwhelming visitors with too much information.
                I started by breaking it out in different sections based on importance and/or priority. From there, I
                worked my way up to what you see here. Even if this site consists of several sections, it feels smooth
                to navigate which makes for a good user experience.The woman of the year was Alice Ball, so I
                illustrated her portrait using Adobe Illustrator and added it to the hero portion of the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                I went through three mockup phases before the final result.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Portrait was designed in Adobe Illustrator<br>
                    Overall design was done in Adobe XD</i>
            </p>
