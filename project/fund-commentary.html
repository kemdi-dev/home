            <p>
                Major changes</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a tile format instead of a standard list modernizes the page and makes it easier to
                    navigate</li>
                <li>The filters for “quarter” and “year” have been removed. Previously, every commentary ever
                    uploaded was visible on this page so those filters were necessary but now we only have
                    about 14 displayed. Once a newer commentary is uploaded, the previous one is removed
                    from the page.</li>
                <li>“Fund commentary” has also been removed from the commentary title since that’s also
                    redundant, i.e. CI Canadian REIT ETF – Fund Commentary – June 2024</li>
                <li>I decided to leave the month/year as part of the fund title because it’s important.
                    Sometimes we can have a commentary from May and another commentary from June
                    posted on the page at the same time – depending on when we receive the PDFs. You can
                    see an example of this in the screenshot below:</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There’s a commentary from May and another from March because we haven’t received the newer versions yet.
            </p>
            <p>in addition to these generl notes, i stated more specific UI/UX changes</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The entire tile should be clickable – not just the download icon</li>
                <li>For accessibility purposes:
                    o If using an "img" tag please include alt text: download icon
                    o If using an svg path, please include a title: download icon</li>
                <li>The height of the tiles should be the same on each row (see screenshot):</li>
                <li>The font style for the fund title should be the default paragraph style for GAM. The font size
                    for the team name should be about 7px smaller than the fund title.</li>
                <li>There will be four columns and four rows in the default desktop screen, as seen in the XD
                    design, which means a maximum of 16 tiles should be shown by default. For situations
                    where we have more than 16 commentaries displayed, there should be a load more button

                    o For tablets, there should be two tiles per row

                    o For smaller screens, there should be one tile. On mobile (on the current site), 10
                    commentaries are displayed by default then the “LOAD MORE” button. Let’s keep
                    that behaviour.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>The AEM Component</h3>

            <p>
                To get this page built out for future uses, I also provided a prototype for a new Adobe Experience
                Manager component with an easier user experience.
            </p>


            <h4>1. Using the naming convention of the pdf to auto-populate the fund commentary page</h4>
            <p>An example of the naming system currently being used:</p>
            <p>
                (English) CI-Munro-Global-Growth-Equity-Fund-June2024.pdf
                (French) Fonds-d'actions-mondiales-axées-sur-la-croissance-CI-Munro-Juin2024.pdf
                - The name of this fund in English is “CI Munro Global Growth Equity Fund” and the name in french is
                “Fonds d'actions mondiales axées sur la croissance CI Munro”
            </p>
            <p>Things to consider:</p>
            <p><span class="bold">I.</span> The team filter/tag. There are 6 in total</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Alternatives</li>
                <li>Auspice Capital Advisors</li>
                <li>ETF</li>
                <li>Marret Asset Management</li>
                <li>Munro Partners</li>
                <li>Sector Equity</li>
                <li>**These teams are added through “Tagging” on AEM: [redacted link]</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The naming convention can be updated if needed. Acronoyms that indicate the different teams can be added
                to the end of the pdf. Similar to this: <br>
                (EN) CI-Munro-Global-Growth-Equity-Fund-June2024-MP.pdf <br>
                (FR) Fonds-d'actions-mondiales-axées-sur-la-croissance-CI-Munro-Juin2024 -MP.pdf <br>
                Here, MP stands for “Munro Partners”
            </p>

            <p>We can use different acronyms to identify the teams:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>AL – Alternatives</li>
                <li>AC - Auspice capital advisors</li>
                <li>ET - ETF</li>
                <li>MA - Marret asset management</li>
                <li>MP - Munro partners</li>
                <li>SE - Sector equity</li>
                <li>**Note that the team names are not translated to French. They are the same in English and French
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="bold">II.</span> The funds page: [redacted link]</p>

            <p>
                The funds team uses a json feed to retrieve the “fund commentary” link from the Fund Commentaries page
                [redacted code snippet]
            </p>

            <p>
                Ex. https://funds.cifinancial.com/en/funds/alternative_investments/JFTStrategiesFund.html
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="bold">III.</span>
                When a fund commentary is removed from the fund commentary page, the article page is unpublished
                but the PDF is still available in the DAM. We don’t delete or unpublish the files. This can be something
                we do in the future if needed.
            </p>


            <h4>2. Using a component to update the fund commentary page</h4>
            <p>
                This may be easier to implement since we already have a similar component: the biography component. You
                can see that component being used on some of the GAM pages like the ETF page [redacted link]
            </p>
            <p>
                We can leverager that behaviour and finetune it for this specific use case
            </p>

            <p>New component design</p>

            <div class="images flex">
                <div class="card">
                    <img src="img/fund-commentary-ref-1.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <img src="img/fund-commentary-ref-2.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <img src="img/fund-commentary-component-1.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <img src="img/fund-commentary-component-2.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Benefits:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The naming convention of the PDFs won’t matter.</li>
                <li>This will significantly cut down on the time needed to upload and remove multiple commentaries.
                    We’ll be
                    able to add several commentaries at the same time rather than having to create an article page for
                    ~every~ fund commentary. This also means less “dummy” pages in our repo.</li>
                <li>With this component, we’ll also be able to arrange the commentaries however we please.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>UI/UX notes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Path to commentary links to the PDF</li>
                <li>The fund title is displayed on the tile, i.e. if the fund title is “CI Enhanced Government Bond ETF
                    – June
                    2024” and Marret Asset Management is selected under “Team” then this is how the tile will be
                    displayed:</li>

                <li>Team should have the 6 different options</li>
                <li>Accent colour refers to the colour of the download icon and the colour of the team name. The default
                    should be #3e71aa which is being used on the current fund commentary page. There should be three
                    other
                    choices: sapphire, black, white.</li>

                <li>The colour choices for tile background colour should be the same as the background colours on the
                    container component: none, black, white, sapphire, slate, gold, link, graphite, platinum, grey,
                    burgundy,
                    cobalt. “white” should be the default colour.</li>

                <li>Tile outline refers to the drop shadow. There should be two options: drop shadow and none. “Drop
                    shadow”
                    should be the default.</li>
                <li>The default fund title style should be the same paragraph styling that’s currently being used on the
                    fund
                    commentary page. The other font styles should be available as a choice, i.e. Headline 1 – Dark,
                    Headline 1 –
                    Light, Headline 2 – Dark, Headline 2 – Light, etc.</li>
            </ul>
